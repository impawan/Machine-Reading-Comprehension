The angry king ordered his guards to put his minister in prison. The
minister had argued with the king on some law and order issue.
One day, the emperor made a visit to the prison. The minister was lost in
his own world. The king told him, “I will release you on one condition. You
need to bring me a horse that is neither white, nor black, nor brown, nor
grey.” The minister was astonished at this demand. However, he agreed to
this condition.
A week later, the minister came to the palace. “Have you found the horse?”,
the king asked. “Yes, my Lord,”the minister replied. “But I will show him to
you only auspicious day.” The king agreed. “Let me know the next
auspicious day.”
The minister replied, “ I will show you the horse on any day, other than
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or
Sunday.”
The king burst out laughing. He was cleverly outsmarted by his minister.
The minister was released and promoted to the next higher position.
