# Machine-Reading-Comprehension
This project I have started to implement the Machine reading compression in python. As of now I have developed a pilot script that reads the 
Text file and based on text content tried to answer question asked by user on prompt. In current I am using text similarity between question asked and all the lines in the text to find the index of line from text or passage which matches best.
